Automating filling up teacher evaluation and course evaluation survey forms

I tried to automate my semester end evaluation forms, beacuse they gave us [(2 semsters(this' & previous') x professors' evaluation) + (2 semster(this' & previous') x course's evaluation)] x >15 Q each consisting both ordinal and text answers.
I was seeing students walking around, phones in their hand putting in answers like a rosary. 

Using selenium and chromedriver, I automate Login, Form opening, filling and submission.
